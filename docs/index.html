<h1>Interactive plots related to additional analyses of Huanan Market environmental samples.</h1>
<p>This page has some additional interactive plots that extend the analysis of the Huanan Market environmental
samples.
The extended analysis is in the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vead089">Bloom, Virus Evolution, vead089</a>, and builds on an earlier analysis
reported in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/9/2/vead050/7249794">Bloom et al (2023)</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, these plots compare the SARS-CoV-2 reads to reads for several other animal
coronaviruses, especially focusing on the samples collected on Jan-12-2020 (the date of most wildlife-stall sampling). Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="viral_counts.html">total number of reads mapping to different viruses across samples</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="viral_reads_per_sample.html">number of reads mapping to different viruses for each sample</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="viral_subset_species_corr.html">number of reads mapping to different viruses versus number of reads mapping to mitochondria of key species for samples from Jan-12-2020</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="viral_all_species_corr.html">number of reads mapping to different viruses versus number of reads mapping to mitochondria of all species for all samples</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
